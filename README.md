# BigDataATLAS.
# This is mainly for the searching of the Higgs Boson.
# We're searching for the Higgs using the gluon decay channel.
# For the past few months we did other tasks like learning how to use python to do some tasks like making histograms.
# In the books we learnt how to find the Higgs Boson through Reading ROOT Files, preparing and filling histograms and selecting events.
