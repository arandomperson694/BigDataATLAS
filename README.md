# BigDataATLAS.
- This is mainly for the searching of the Higgs Boson.
- We are searching for the Higgs using the gluon-gluon decay channel.
- For the past few months we learned how to use python to do multiple tasks like making histograms.
- In the books we learnt how to find the Higgs Boson through reading ROOT Files, preparing and filling histograms and selecting events.
